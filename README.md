# react-express-test-app

This repository is meant to showcase how the client (frontend) is connected together to the api (backend).
It can be used as a boilerplate starting point for an app.

There are two separate projects, the api + client.

## Run API (backend)

1. In the terminal (command line), cd into ```api``` directory.
2. Run ```npm install``` for dependencies.
3. Run ```npm start``` to begin the API.

## Run client (frontend)

1. In another terminal (command line), cd into ```client``` directory.
2. Run ```npm install``` for dependencies.
3. Run ```npm start``` to begin the client.
